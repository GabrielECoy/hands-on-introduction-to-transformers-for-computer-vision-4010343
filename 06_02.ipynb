    "# Evaluating ViTs\n",
    "## Chapter 6 Module 2\n",
    "In this module, we will be covering how we can perform basic evaluation on most types of ViTs. One of the great parts of FiftyOne is that once your data and model predictions are in FiftyOne, evaluation becomes easy, no matter if you are coming from different formats. Gone are the days of converting your YOLO styled predictions to COCO styled evaluation, FiftyOne handles all the conversions for you so you can focus on the task at hand.\n",
